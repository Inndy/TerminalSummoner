# TerminalSummoner

## Deprecation

This project is deprecated since we finally had `global summon` feature in the [Windows Terminal v1.9](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/8888)

This tool will register following global hotkeys to open Windows Terminal

| Hotkey         | Function                                            |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Win-Alt-Space  | Toggle terminal window or spawn new terminal window |
| Win-Alt-N      | Spawn a new terminal window                         |

### Setup auto-run

1. Copy `TerminalSummoner.exe`
2. Press `Win-R` and type `shell:startup`
3. Right-click and select `Paste shortcut`
